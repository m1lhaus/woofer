Whole written in Python and Qt provides easy, reliable, and high quality playback thanks to **LibVLC library** developed by [VideoLAN community](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html \"\").\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n- **Wide media support:** Woofer will play all audio what [VLC Media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.php?cat=audio \"\") can play.\r\n- **Folder based:** Your music is not ordered by album or interpret name, but only by its folder structure (on disk).\r\n- **Multi-platform:** Currently supports both Windows (XP and higher) and Linux (tested on Ubuntu distros).\r\n- **Fully portable:** No installation needed. Woofer will play right from your pen drive. \r\n- more will be coming ...\r\n\r\n## Cross-platform\r\n\r\nThanks to Python, Qt and LibVLC, Woofer is developed to run on multiple operating systems. **Windows, Linux and Mac OS** platforms are supported. Currently Woofer is being tested only on Windows and Linux distribution, because I don't have any Mac OS device to test and debug. \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"max-width:100p;height:auto;\" src=\"http://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1lhaus/woofer/master/doc/img/woofer-mp.jpg\"></div>\r\n\r\n## Open-source\r\n\r\nMost recent code is always available here on Github. Python code is readable, well documented and self-explanatory. Feel free to join or fork the project. Woofer is published under **GPL v2 license**.\r\n\r\n**Used packages (Requirements):**\r\n\r\n- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\r\n- [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download) (Qt 4.8)\r\n- [LibVLC Python wrapper](https://wiki.videolan.org/Python_bindings/)\r\n- [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki) (only for build)\r\n- Python packages - [Send2Trash](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Send2Trash), [Python-XLib](http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/) (only for Linux)\r\n\r\nWoofer uses new PyQt4 API v2, so migration to PyQt5/Python3 is possible and quite easy. But, I will stick with Python 2.7 because there is no reliable bug-free alternative to PyInstaller for Python 3.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nFor Windows there are available binary distributions. On Linux you can run Woofer like any other Python application by `woofer.py`. Linux binary distribution will come later.\r\n\r\n### Binaries\r\n\r\nLatest binary version for Windows can be found in [release section](https://github.com/m1lhaus/woofer/releases). This is a standalone version, no other libraries or VLC is needed!\r\n\r\n### Run from source\r\n\r\nRefer to requirements for all needed packages to run Woofer. Both for Windows and Linux there are available suitable binaries (PyQt, etc.). No need to build anything from source. Unfortunately you also need VLC Media player installed (core libraries). Note that all these libraries are shipped with Woofer binary distribution.\r\n\r\nFinally run `woofer.py` or `woofer.py --debug` in debug mode. \r\n\r\n### Build from source (Windows)\r\n\r\nRefer to requirements for all needed packages to run Woofer. Don't forget to install and add PyInstaller to your PATH. You also need to provide VLC libraries to build standalone distribution. Download and extract VLC Media player (ZIP package) to `.\\libvlc` folder. Not all VLC files are needed. To delete unused files, run Woofer. Woofer will now locate VLC binaries in `.\\libvlc` folder and loads them into memory. Now all needed .dll files are held by operating system, so when you try to delete `.\\libvlc` folder, only used files held by OS will remain (dirty but simple solution).\r\n\r\nNow when you have all packages installed and LibVLC core libraries prepared, you can run `.\\build\\build_win.py`. Result will be stored in `.\\build\\release` directory.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\n- multiple selection\r\n- automatic application updates\r\n- Linux binary distribution\r\n- save/load playlists\r\n- media streaming (live broadcasts)","google":"UA-58291606-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
